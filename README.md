# Dotfiles

Based on the wonderful [dotfiles by Freek](https://github.com/freekmurze/dotfiles)

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

```
git clone git@github.com:SamuelNitsche/dev-dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./bootstrap
```
